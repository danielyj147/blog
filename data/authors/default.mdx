Hi, I'm Daniel, and I enjoy crafting tools that make life a little easier.
Of course, I ~~always~~ sometimes make the mistake of overcomplicating things and end up with something that does the opposite,
but I find real beauty in iterating, simplifying, and refining what I create.

Here's a quote from Coach Lombardi that I often remind myself of when I'm feeling frustrated:

> Perfection is not attainable, but if we chase perfection, we can catch excellence.

I can't say I'm a perfect developerâ€”there are plenty of things I'd like to improve,
whether it's on the cybersecurity solutions I developed during my military service or the
[online community](https://wion237.com) that I am currently building.
But as I pursue something I know may be impossible, I hope one day to catch excellence along the way.
