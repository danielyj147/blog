### The Principle of Mathematical Induction

If $P(n)$ is a sentence dependent on $n$ and

1.  $P(n)$ is true for some natural number $a$.
2.  $P(k)$ being true implies $P(k+1)$ is also true.

then $P(n)$ is true for all natural numbers greater than or equal to $a$.

#### Tip: When proving by induction,

1.  Start with a number of base cases (usually one or two).
2.  State the induction hypothesis: "Assume $P(k)$ is true for some $k$".
3.  Inductive step: prove the implication for $P(k+1)$.

### Commutative Property

$$a*b = b*a$$

### Associative Property

$$a*(b*c) = (a*b)*c$$

### The Principle of Strong Mathematical Induction

If $P(n)$ is a sentence dependent on $n$ and

1.  $P(a), P(a+1), \dots , P(a+l)$ are true for some $a \in \mathbb{N}$ and some $l \in \mathbb{N}$.
2.  $P(m)$ being true for all $m$ where $a \le m \le k$ implies $P(k+1)$ is true.

then $P(n)$ is true for all $n$ greater than or equal to $a$.

---

#### Example

Let $a_0=1, a_1=4$ and

$$a_{n+1} = 4a_n - 4a_{n-1} \quad \text{for } n \ge 1.$$

Prove that

$$a_n = (n+1)2^n \quad \text{for } n \in \mathbb{N}.$$

#### Proof

1.  **Base Cases**

    We check the first two cases since the recurrence relation depends on the two preceding terms.

    For $n=0$:
    $$a_0 = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad (0+1)2^0 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1$$
    The formula holds for $n=0$.

    For $n=1$:
    $$a_1 = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad (1+1)2^1 = 2 \cdot 2 = 4$$
    The formula holds for $n=1$.

2.  **Inductive Hypothesis**

    Assume that for all integers $m$ with $0 \le m \le k$ (where $k \ge 1$), the formula is true:
    $$a_m = (m+1)2^m$$

3.  **Inductive Step**

    We want to prove the formula for $n = k+1$.

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    a_{k+1} &= 4a_k - 4a_{k-1} && \text{(from the definition)} \\
    &= 4((k+1)2^k) - 4(k \cdot 2^{k-1}) && \text{(by inductive hypothesis)} \\
    &= (k+1) \cdot 2^2 \cdot 2^k - k \cdot 2^2 \cdot 2^{k-1} \\
    &= (k+1)2^{k+2} - k \cdot 2^{k+1} \\
    &= (k+1) \cdot 2 \cdot 2^{k+1} - k \cdot 2^{k+1} \\
    &= [2(k+1) - k] \cdot 2^{k+1} \\
    &= (2k + 2 - k) \cdot 2^{k+1} \\
    &= (k+2) \cdot 2^{k+1} \\
    &= ((k+1)+1)2^{k+1}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    This is the required formula for $n=k+1$.

By the principle of strong induction, the formula $a_n = (n+1)2^n$ holds for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

### Induction vs Strong Induction

The main difference between **mathematical induction (weak induction)** and **strong mathematical induction** lies in the inductive hypothesis:

- In **mathematical induction**, the inductive step assumes the statement $P(k)$ is true for a single integer $k$, and then proves $P(k+1)$ based on just that assumption.
- In **strong mathematical induction**, the inductive step assumes the statement $P(m)$ is true for _all_ integers $m$ from the base case $a$ up to $k$, and then proves $P(k+1)$ based on that stronger assumption.

#### When to use which?

- **Use weak induction** when the truth of $P(k+1)$ depends only on the immediately preceding case $P(k)$.
- **Use strong induction** when $P(k+1)$ depends on multiple previous cases, such as in proofs involving recurrence relations like the one above.

### Summary:

| Aspect                   | Mathematical Induction                               | Strong Mathematical Induction                   |
| :----------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Inductive Hypothesis** | Assume $P(k)$ is true                                | Assume $P(m)$ is true for all $a \le m \le k$   |
| **Use Case**             | Next case depends only on the immediately prior case | Next case depends on any or all prior cases     |
| **Equivalence**          | Both are logically equivalent in power               | Can simplify proofs that rely on earlier states |

### The Well-Ordering Principle

If $S$ is a non-empty subset of $\mathbb{N}$, then $S$ has a least element. That is, there exists an element $m \in S$ such that $m \le s$ for all $s \in S$.

#### Proof by Contradiction

Assume for contradiction that there is a non-empty subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ with no minimum element.

Let $T = \mathbb{N} \setminus S$. We will prove by strong induction that $T = \mathbb{N}$.

1.  **Base Case** ($n=0$)

    If $0 \in S$, then $0$ would be the minimum element of $S$ (since it's the minimum of $\mathbb{N}$). This contradicts our assumption that $S$ has no minimum. Therefore, $0 \notin S$, which means $0 \in T$.

2.  **Inductive Hypothesis**

    Assume that for some $k \ge 0$, all integers $m$ such that $0 \le m \le k$ are in $T$.

3.  **Inductive Step**

    We want to show that $k+1 \in T$. From the inductive hypothesis, we know that $0, 1, 2, \dots, k$ are not in $S$. If $k+1$ were in $S$, it would be the smallest element of $S$. But $S$ has no minimum, so $k+1$ cannot be in $S$. Thus, $k+1 \in T$.

By the principle of strong mathematical induction, $n \in T$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. This implies $S$ is an empty set, which contradicts our initial assumption that $S$ is non-empty.

Thus, the well-ordering principle is true.

### Greatest Common Divisor

Given two integers $a$ and $b$, not both zero, their **greatest common divisor**, denoted $gcd(a,b)$ or $(a,b)$, is a positive integer $d$ satisfying:

1.  $d$ divides $a$ and $d$ divides $b$.
2.  If any integer $d'$ divides both $a$ and $b$, then $d'$ must also divide $d$.

---

### Theorem 1: Division Algorithm

Given natural numbers $m$ and $n$ with $n \neq 0$,
there exists natural number $q$ called quotient and $r$ called remainder such that $m=q \cdot n + r$ and $0 \le r \le n$.
Furthermore $q$ and $r$ are unique.

#### Proof of Theorem 1 using induction

1. Base Cases
   1. If $m=0$ $m=0*n+0$ and $0 \le r \le 0$
   1. If $m=1$
      1. $n=1$: $m=1=1*1+0$ $0 \le r \le 1$
      1. $n>1$: $m=1=0*n+1$ $0 \le 1 \le n$
1. Inductive Hypothesis  
   Assume $P(k)$ is true for some $k$. So
   $$
   k = \tilde{q} \cdot n + \tilde{r}
   $$
   with $\tilde{q}$ and $\tilde{r}$ as natural numbers and $ 0 \le \tilde{r} \le n$
1. Inductive Step  
   We know $k = \tilde{q} \cdot n + \tilde{r}$ with $\tilde{q}$ and $\tilde{r}$ as natural numbers and $0 \le \tilde{r} \le n$  
   We have two cases

   - Case 1: $0 \le \tilde{r} < n-1$:  
      $k+1=\tilde{q} \cdot n + \tilde{r} + 1$ and $ 1 \le \tilde{r} +1 < n$. So $q=\tilde{q}$ and $r=\tilde{r}+1$, clearly $q$ and $r$ are both natual numbers and $0 \le r < n$
   - Case 2: $\tilde{r} = n-1$
     $$
     \begin{aligned}
     k+1 &= \tilde{q} \cdot n + \tilde{r} + 1 \\
     &= \tilde{q} \cdot n + n - 1 + 1 \\
     &= (\tilde{q} + 1) \cdot n
     \end{aligned}
     $$
     so
     $$
     q = \tilde{q}  + 1 \quad \text{and} \\
     r = 0
     $$

Clearly, $q$ and $r$ are natural numbers and $0 \le r < n $.
This completes inductive steop. So by the principle of mathematical induction, given fixed n, it is true that $m=q \cdot n +r$, for some natural numbers $q$ and $r$, with $0 \le r < n$, for all $m$ natural numbers.

For the uniqueness, assume taht $m = q - n + r$ with $q, q', r, r'$ as natural numbers and $0 \le r, r' < n$

$$
qn + r = q'n + r'
$$

Assume without loss of generality $r \le r'$, so

$$
\begin{aligned}
r - r' &= q'n - qn \\
r - r' &= (q'-q)n
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $n > r, r' \ge 0$, then $0 \le r-r' < n$
Also $r-r'$ is a multiple of $n$.

So $r-r'=0, r=r'$ and $0=(q'-q)n. 
Since $n=0$, the zero product theorem gurantees $q'-q=0$ so $q=q'$.

### Theorem 2: Characterization of the GCD / Bezout's Identity

Let $a, b$ be integers, not both zero. The greatest common divisor $gcd(a,b)$ exists and is the smallest positive integer that can be expressed as a linear combination of $a$ and $b$. That is:

$$
gcd(a,b) = \min
\begin{cases}
  ma+nb: m,n \in \mathbb{Z} \\
  ma+nb > 0
\end{cases}
$$

`m, n are integears, not natural numbers!`

### Identity element

$e$ where $e \in S$ and $e \cdot a = a \cdot e = a$

$e$ should **NOT** change depending on $a$

#### Pitfalls

- 0 is not an identity element of subtraction
  $$0 - a \neq a-0$$
- 1 is not an identity element of exponentitation
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  a^1 &= a \\
  1^a &\neq a
  \end{aligned}
  $$

#### Tip

- If you want to check if it's an identity element, check if
  $$
  \begin{cases}
  a * e = a \\
  e * a = a
  \end{cases}
  $$

### Right Identity Element`

$a * e = a$, but $e * a = a$ is not necessarily true.

$$
a^1 = a \quad \text{for all positive integer } a
$$

### Inverse Element

If $a, b \in S$ such that $a * b = b * a = e$, then $b$ is inverse of $a$

e.g.,

$$
\begin{cases}
a+b=e \quad e=0 \text{ for addition} \\
b+a=e
\end{cases}
$$

### Proving Equality

$$
\begin{array}{l}
  1. \ p=q \iff p \le q \text{ and } p \ge q \\
  2. \ A=B \iff A \subseteq B \text{ and } B \subseteq A \\
  3. \ a=b \iff a \mid b \text{ and } b \mid a
\end{array}
$$

### Group: $(G, *)$

1. Closed
2. Associative
3. Identity
4. Inverse

[+] Commutative: **Abelian Group**

#### Examples:

1. Abelian Groups: $(\mathbb{Z}, +), (\mathbb{Q}, +), (\mathbb{R}, +), (M_{2 \times 3}(\mathbb{R}), +), (P(s), \Delta)$
1. Non-abelian Groups: $(GC_2(\mathbb{R}, \cdot)), \text{Bijective} (S^S, \circ)$
1. Non-group: $(\mathbb{N}, +), (M_2(\mathbb{R}), \cdot), (S^S, \circ)$

#### Pitfalls

- $(\mathbb{N}, +)$ is not a group because there is no inverse(negative)

### Right / Left Group

1. Closed
2. Associative
3. R/L Identity($a*e=a / e*a = a$)
4. R/L Inverse($a*b=e / b*a = e$)

### Lemma 4: Euclid's Lemma / Super Property of Prime Numbers

Let $a, b, p \in \mathbb{N}$ with $p$ as prime.

If $p \mid ab$ then $p \mid a$ or $p \mid b$

#### Proof of Lemma 4

{/* Todo: add lemma 4 proof (sep 8 note) */}

> Coming Soon

### Prime

We say that $p$ is prime if it has exactly 2 divisors 1 and $p$.

### Coprime

We say $a$ and $b$ are coprime if $\gcd(a,b)=1$

### Corollary 3: Characterization of Corpime

$a$ and $b$ are coprime if and only if there exists integers $\tilde{m}$ and $\tilde{n}$ such that
$a\tilde{m} + b\tilde{n} = 1$
