## Number Theory Review

### The Principle of Mathematical Induction

If $P(n)$ is a sentence dependent on $n$ and

1. $P(n)$ is true for some natural number $a$
2. $P(k)$ being true implies $P(k+1)$ is also true

then $P(n)$ is true for all natural numbers greater than or equal to $a$

#### Tip: When proving by induction,

1. Start with a number of base cases(usually one or two).
2. State induction hypothesis: "Assume $P(k)$ is true for some $k$, so $$k= \vdots $$".
3. Inductive step: prove diffrent cases.

### Commutative Property

### Associative Property

### The Principle of Strong Mathematical Induction

if P(n) is a sentence dependent on n and

1. $$P(a), P(a+1), ... , P(a+l)$$ are true for some $$a \in \mathbb{N}$$
2. $$P(m)$$ being true for all m ...
