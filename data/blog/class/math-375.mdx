## Foundational Principles of Proof

### The Principle of Mathematical Induction

If $P(n)$ is a sentence dependent on $n$ and:

1.  $P(n)$ is true for some natural number $a$.
2.  $P(k)$ being true implies $P(k+1)$ is also true.

Then $P(n)$ is true for all natural numbers $n \ge a$.

#### Tip: When proving by induction:

1.  Start with a number of base cases (usually one or two).
2.  State the induction hypothesis: "Assume $P(k)$ is true for some $k \ge a$".
3.  Inductive step: Prove the implication for $P(k+1)$.

### The Principle of Strong Mathematical Induction

If $P(n)$ is a sentence dependent on $n$ and:

1.  $P(a), P(a+1), \dots , P(a+l)$ are true for some $a \in \mathbb{N}$ and some $l \in \mathbb{N}$.
2.  $P(m)$ being true for all $m$ where $a \le m \le k$ implies $P(k+1)$ is true.

Then $P(n)$ is true for all $n \ge a$.

#### Example

Let $a_0=1, a_1=4$ and $a_{n+1} = 4a_n - 4a_{n-1}$ for $n \ge 1$. Prove that $a_n = (n+1)2^n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

#### Proof

1.  **Base Cases**: We check $n=0$ and $n=1$ since the recurrence relation depends on the two preceding terms.

    - For $n=0$: $a_0 = 1$ and $(0+1)2^0 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1$. The formula holds.
    - For $n=1$: $a_1 = 4$ and $(1+1)2^1 = 2 \cdot 2 = 4$. The formula holds.

2.  **Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume that for some $k \ge 1$, the formula $a_m = (m+1)2^m$ is true for all integers $m$ with $0 \le m \le k$.

3.  **Inductive Step**: We want to prove the formula for $n = k+1$.
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    a_{k+1} &= 4a_k - 4a_{k-1} && \text{(By definition)} \\
    &= 4((k+1)2^k) - 4(k \cdot 2^{k-1}) && \text{(By inductive hypothesis)} \\
    &= (k+1) \cdot 2^2 \cdot 2^k - k \cdot 2^2 \cdot 2^{k-1} \\
    &= (k+1)2^{k+2} - k \cdot 2^{k+1} \\
    &= 2(k+1)2^{k+1} - k \cdot 2^{k+1} \\
    &= [2(k+1) - k] \cdot 2^{k+1} \\
    &= (2k + 2 - k) \cdot 2^{k+1} \\
    &= (k+2) \cdot 2^{k+1} \\
    &= ((k+1)+1)2^{k+1}
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    This is the required formula for $n=k+1$.

By the principle of strong induction, the formula $a_n = (n+1)2^n$ holds for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

### Induction vs. Strong Induction

The main difference between **mathematical induction (weak induction)** and **strong mathematical induction** lies in the inductive hypothesis.

- In **weak induction**, the inductive step assumes the statement $P(k)$ is true for a single integer $k$ and proves $P(k+1)$.
- In **strong induction**, the inductive step assumes the statement $P(m)$ is true for _all_ integers $m$ from the base case up to $k$ and proves $P(k+1)$.

| **Use Case**             | The next case depends only on the immediately prior case. | The next case depends on any or all prior cases (e.g., recurrence relations). |
| **Equivalence**          | Both methods are logically equivalent in power.           | Can simplify proofs that rely on earlier states.                              |

### The Well-Ordering Principle

If $S$ is a non-empty subset of $\mathbb{N}$, then $S$ has a least element. That is, there exists an element $m \in S$ such that $m \le s$ for all $s \in S$.

#### Proof by Contradiction

Assume for contradiction that there is a non-empty subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ with no minimum element. Let $T = \mathbb{N} \setminus S$. We will prove by strong induction that $T = \mathbb{N}$.

1.  **Base Case** ($n=0$): If $0 \in S$, it would be the minimum element of $S$. This contradicts our assumption. Therefore, $0 \notin S$, which means $0 \in T$.

2.  **Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume that for some $k \ge 0$, all integers $m$ such that $0 \le m \le k$ are in $T$.

3.  **Inductive Step**: We want to show that $k+1 \in T$. From the hypothesis, $0, 1, \dots, k$ are not in $S$. If $k+1$ were in $S$, it would be the smallest element of $S$. But $S$ has no minimum, so $k+1 \notin S$. Thus, $k+1 \in T$.

By the principle of strong induction, $T = \mathbb{N}$. This implies $S$ is empty, contradicting our initial assumption that $S$ is non-empty. Thus, the well-ordering principle holds.

### Proving Equality

Here are common strategies for proving equality in different mathematical contexts:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
  1. \ p=q \iff p \le q \text{ and } p \ge q \quad (\text{for numbers}) \\
  2. \ A=B \iff A \subseteq B \text{ and } B \subseteq A \quad (\text{for sets}) \\
  3. \ a=b \iff a \mid b \text{ and } b \mid a \quad (\text{for positive integers})
\end{array}
$$

## Core Concepts in Number Theory

### Theorem 1: The Division Algorithm

Given natural numbers $m$ and $n$ with $n \neq 0$, there exist unique natural numbers $q$ (quotient) and $r$ (remainder) such that $m = q \cdot n + r$ and $0 \le r < n$.

#### Proof of Theorem 1 (Existence by Induction)

Let $n$ be a fixed natural number. We prove by induction on $m$ that the statement $P(m)$: "there exist $q, r \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $m = qn + r$ and $0 \le r < n$" is true for all $m \in \mathbb{N}$.

1.  **Base Cases**:

    - If $m=0$, then $0 = 0 \cdot n + 0$. Here $q=0, r=0$, and $0 \le 0 < n$.
    - If $m=1$:
      - If $n=1$: $1 = 1 \cdot 1 + 0$. ($q=1, r=0$)
      - If $n>1$: $1 = 0 \cdot n + 1$. ($q=0, r=1$)

2.  **Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume $P(k)$ is true for some $k \ge 0$. So, $k = \tilde{q}n + \tilde{r}$ with $\tilde{q}, \tilde{r} \in \mathbb{N}$ and $0 \le \tilde{r} < n$.

3.  **Inductive Step**: Consider $k+1$.
    - **Case 1**: $0 \le \tilde{r} < n-1$.
      Then $k+1 = \tilde{q}n + \tilde{r} + 1$. Let $q=\tilde{q}$ and $r=\tilde{r}+1$. Then $1 \le r < n$.
    - **Case 2**: $\tilde{r} = n-1$.
      $$
      k+1 = \tilde{q}n + (n-1) + 1 = \tilde{q}n + n = (\tilde{q}+1)n
      $$
      Let $q = \tilde{q}+1$ and $r=0$. Then $0 \le r < n$.

This completes the inductive step.

#### Proof of Uniqueness

Assume $m = qn + r$ and $m = q'n + r'$ where $q, q', r, r' \in \mathbb{N}$ and $0 \le r, r' < n$.
$$qn + r = q'n + r' \implies (q-q')n = r' - r$$
Without loss of generality, assume $r' \ge r$. Then $0 \le r'-r < n$.
Since $r'-r$ is a multiple of $n$ and is strictly less than $n$, it must be $0$.
So, $r'-r = 0 \implies r'=r$.
This implies $(q-q')n = 0$. Since $n \neq 0$, we must have $q-q'=0 \implies q=q'$.

### Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

Given two integers $a$ and $b$, not both zero, their **greatest common divisor**, denoted $gcd(a,b)$ or $(a,b)$, is a positive integer $d$ satisfying:

1.  $d$ divides both $a$ and $b$ (i.e., $d|a$ and $d|b$).
2.  If any integer $d'$ divides both $a$ and $b$, then $d'$ must also divide $d$.

---

### Theorem 2: Characterization of the GCD (Bezout's Identity)

Let $a, b$ be integers, not both zero. The $gcd(a,b)$ is the smallest positive integer that can be expressed as a linear combination of $a$ and $b$.
$$gcd(a,b) = \min \{ ma+nb > 0 \mid m,n \in \mathbb{Z} \}$$
**Note**: $m, n$ are integers, not just natural numbers!

### Prime and Coprime Numbers

- **Prime**: A natural number $p > 1$ is **prime** if its only positive divisors are 1 and $p$.
- **Coprime**: Two integers $a$ and $b$ are **coprime** (or relatively prime) if $gcd(a,b)=1$.

---

### Corollary 3: Characterization of Coprime Numbers

Integers $a$ and $b$ are coprime if and only if there exist integers $m$ and $n$ such that $am + bn = 1$.

#### Proof of Corollary 3

> Proof to be added (from Sep 5 notes).

---

### Lemma 4: Euclid's Lemma

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $p$ be a prime number. If $p \mid ab$, then $p \mid a$ or $p \mid b$.

#### Proof of Lemma 4

> Proof to be added (from Sep 8 notes).

---

### Theorem 5: Infinitude of Primes

There are infinitely many prime numbers.

---

### Theorem 6: The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (Unique Factorization)

Every integer $n>1$ can be represented as a product of prime numbers. This representation is unique, apart from the order of the factors.

More formally, for any integer $n > 1$, there exist unique primes $p_1 < p_2 < \dots < p_k$ and unique positive integers $e_1, e_2, \dots, e_k$ such that:
$$n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$$

## Introduction to Algebraic Structures

### Basic Properties of Binary Operations

Let $*$ be a binary operation on a set $S$.

- **Commutative Property**: $a * b = b * a$ for all $a, b \in S$.
- **Associative Property**: $a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c$ for all $a, b, c \in S$.

---

### Identity and Inverse Elements

- **Identity Element**: An element $e \in S$ is an identity element if $e * a = a * e = a$ for all $a \in S$. The identity element must be unique for the entire set.

  - **Right Identity**: An element $e_R$ is a right identity if $a * e_R = a$ for all $a \in S$.
  - **Pitfalls**: `0` is not an identity for subtraction because $0-a \neq a$. `1` is a right identity for exponentiation ($a^1 = a$) but not a left identity ($1^a \neq a$).

- **Inverse Element**: If $S$ has an identity element $e$, an element $b \in S$ is the inverse of $a \in S$ if $a * b = b * a = e$.
  - **Right Inverse**: $b_R$ is a right inverse of $a$ if $a * b_R = e$.

---

### Groups

A **group** is a set $G$ combined with a binary operation $*$ that satisfies four axioms:

1.  **Closure**: For all $a, b \in G$, the result $a * b$ is also in $G$.
2.  **Associativity**: For all $a, b, c \in G$, $(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)$.
3.  **Identity Element**: There exists an element $e \in G$ such that for every $a \in G$, $e * a = a * e = a$.
4.  **Inverse Element**: For each $a \in G$, there exists an element $b \in G$ (denoted $a^{-1}$) such that $a * b = b * a = e$.

If a group also satisfies the commutative property, it is called an **Abelian Group**.

#### Examples:

- **Abelian Groups**: $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$, $(\mathbb{Q}, +)$, $(\mathbb{R}, +)$, $(M_{2 \times 3}(\mathbb{R}), +)$
- **Non-Abelian Groups**: $(GL_2(\mathbb{R}), \cdot)$ (invertible 2x2 matrices with matrix multiplication), Bijections on a set $S$ with function composition $(\text{Bij}(S), \circ)$.
- **Not Groups**:
  - $(\mathbb{N}, +)$ lacks inverses.
  - $(M_2(\mathbb{R}), \cdot)$ lacks inverses for singular matrices.
